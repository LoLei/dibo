Minimal Discord bot

## Why
I wanted to see if it's simpler to create a Discord bot using discord.py
than creating an IRC bot from scratch, as I've done [here](https://github.com/LoLei/ircbot).

Who would've thought, it is. Then again, using an IRC library for my IRC bot would probably
also simplify a lot of things compared to handling raw sockets.
